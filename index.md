Before 2017, Android app developers almost exclusively used the Java 6 programming language, with support following for later additions. Java 6 was introduced in 2006, two years before the release of Android devices.

JetBrains developed IntelliJ IDEA, which is the basis for Android Studio. In 2011, the company introduced the Kotlin language, but few Android developers started using it. Though Kotlin was production ready, the language wasn’t stable. When important changes in the language happened, developers had to change their codebase. Five years later, Kotlin released 1.0. Thanks to all the early adopters for this great moment!

At Google I/O 2017, Google announced that Android will support Kotlin as a first-class programming language from now on. For this to happen, the 3.0 release of Android Studio (AS) integrated Kotlin support out of the box! The following three minor releases of AS continued to improve the Kotlin support and the tools available.

Kotlin is a statically-typed, modern programming language that runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) by compiling Kotlin code into Java byte-code. It can also be compiled to JavaScript source code and to native executables. Kotlin is flexible and has some cool features!

Kotlin is now one of the most loved programming languages out there. It’s poised to dominate Android app development.
