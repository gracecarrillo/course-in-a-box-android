# Build your first Android app

![](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/build-your-first-android-app/img/24a081ec057c026e.png)

In this crash course, you'll learn how to build and run your first Android app in the Kotlin programming language.

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the JVM and is completely interoperable with the Java programming language. Kotlin is an officially supported language for developing Android apps, along with Java.

## What you'll learn

- How to use Android Studio to build your app.
- How to run your app on a device or in the emulator.
- How to add interactive buttons.
- How to display a second screen when a button is pressed.

## Use Android Studio and Kotlin to write Android apps

You write Android apps in Kotlin or in the Java programming language using an IDE called Android Studio. Based on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software, Android Studio is an IDE designed specifically for Android development. In this crash course, we'll use Kotlin.

To work through this crash-course, you will need a computer that can run [Android Studio 3.6](https://developer.android.com/studio/) or higher.
