## Install Android Studio

**Note: This version of the codelab requires Android Studio 3.6 or higher.**

You can download Android Studio 3.6 from the [Android Studio page.](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

Android Studio provides a complete IDE, including an advanced code editor and app templates. It also contains tools for development, debugging, testing, and performance that make it faster and easier to develop apps. You can use Android Studio to test your apps with a large range of preconfigured emulators, or on your own mobile device. You can also build production apps and publish apps on the Google Play store.

**Note: Android Studio is continually being improved. For the latest information on system requirements and installation instructions, see the Android Studio download page.**

Android Studio is available for computers running Windows or Linux, and for Macs running macOS. The OpenJDK (Java Development Kit) is bundled with Android Studio.

The installation is similar for all platforms:

- 1. Navigate to the [Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and follow the instructions to download and [install Android Studio.](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html)

- 2. Accept the default configurations for all steps, and ensure that all components are selected for installation.

- 3. After the install is complete, the setup wizard downloads and installs additional components, including the Android SDK. Be patient, because this process might take some time, depending on your internet speed.

- 4. When the installation completes, Android Studio starts, and you are ready to create your first project.

**Troubleshooting: If you run into problems with your installation, see the [Android Studio release notes](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases) or [Troubleshoot Android Studio.](https://developer.android.com/studio/troubleshoot)**
