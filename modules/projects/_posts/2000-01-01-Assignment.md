## E-Portfolio Assignment 

For this Crash Course, your assignment is simply to complete the steps and buid your app! Change the colours, come up with a less boring name than "My New App" and share screenshot(s) of your app as your evidence in your e-portfolio.

You decide how much you want to personlise your app. 

Remember, the important thing is that you learned new skills and hopefully had some fun while doing it!
